'git@github.com:/ajaxorg/node_chat')]` [Enter]\r\n  * Create new files inside your project\r\n  * Add them to to Git by executing the following command\r\n    `git add [file1, file2, file3, ...]` [Enter]\r\n  * Create a commit which can be pushed to the remote you just added\r\n    `git commit -m 'added new files'` [Enter]\r\n  * Push the commit the remote\r\n    `git push [remote name] master` [Enter]\r\n\r\nThat's it!
